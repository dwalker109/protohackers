# Protohackers

My solutions for the [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com) server programming challenges, in Rust.

ALl examples pass the expected test runs. Some of them are implemented in both multithreaded and async
variants, mainly as a learning excercise.

Problems I especially enjoyed include:
- [Speed Demon](https://protohackers.com/problem/6) and [Pest Control](https://protohackers.com/problem/11)
because I found the parsing required for their binary data formats fascinating
- [Job Centre](https://protohackers.com/problem/9) because of the relatively large scale requirements
- [Line Reversal](https://protohackers.com/problem/7) because it taught me loads about UDP and lower level protocol concerns
